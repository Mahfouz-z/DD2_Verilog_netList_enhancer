testcase 1: 
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: cpu.rtlnopwr.v
            technique: sizing up "1"
            max fan-out: 4
            expected results: total delay decreases but not very signficantly
testcase 2:
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: cpu.rtlnopwr.v
            technique: cloning "2"
            expected results: total delay increases but no cells exceed the maximum specified fan-out
testcase 3:
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: spi_ctl.rtlnopwr.v
            technique: buffering "3"
            expected results: the number of buffers increase after the buffering process, no cells violate
                                the maximum fan-out
testcase 4:
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: uart.rtlnopwr.v
            technique: sizing up "1"
            expected results: total delay decreases
testcase 5:
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: output_TC4.v
            technique: cloning "2"
            expected results: the number of cells increase signficantly after cloning but no cells exceed 
            the max fan-out 
testcase 6:
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: test_case.v
            technique: sizing up "1"
            expected results: the main cell increases in size decreasing the total delay
testcase 7:
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: test_case.v
            technique: cloning "2"
            expected results: the main cell is replicated so no cells violate the max fan out 
testcase 8:
            lib: osu035.lib
            netlist: test_case.v
            technique: buffering "1"
            expected results: the main cell is connected to a network of buffers that in turn feed
                                the other cells eliminating the fan-out violation, however the total delay
                                increases due to the addition of new buffer cells
